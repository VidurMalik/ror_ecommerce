  An example Shipping Category could be "Clothing".  Use shipping category to group products that can be shipped with the same shipping method.  For Example:
  %ul
    %li Product "A" can be shipped UPS next day and UPS ground.
    %li Product "B" can be shipped UPS next day and UPS ground.
    %li Product "C" can only be shipped UPS ground.
  %br/
  You will assign Product A  B to the same shipping category.  But Product C would need a different shipping Category.
